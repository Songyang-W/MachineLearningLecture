## notes
### 12/21

when to use deep learning: 1. problems with long lists of rules, 2. continually changing enviroments, 3. discovering insights within large collections of data

when to not use deep learning: 1. when you need explaninability (try to explain data by ourselves), 2. when traditional approach is better, 3. when errors are unacceptable

Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning
Machine Learning: organized structure data, arrays, etc -- Random forest, gradient boosted models, naive bayes, svm
Deep Learning: unstractured data, images, tensors -- neural networks, fully connected NN, CNN, RNN, Transformer

Types of Learning: <b>Supervised Learning, <b>Unsupervised&self-supervised learning, <b>transfer Learning

**seq2seq (translation)**

**Classification/regression (NLP)**

#### PyTorch
