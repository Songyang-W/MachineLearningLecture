when to use deep learning: 1. problems with long lists of rules, 2. continually changing enviroments, 3. discovering insights within large collections of data

when to not use deep learning: 1. when you need explaninability (try to explain data by ourselves), 2. when traditional approach is better, 3. when errors are unacceptable
